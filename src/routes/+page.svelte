<p>It's like a CRM -- but with AI. Each contact gets a thread of communication, and Linker will automatically generate unique and customized messages for each contact -- bearing in mind all communication to that point. Your team should still read each outgoing message before hitting 'send', but it is rare that you will need to change a message. </p>

<p>Basically you could do this with a standard CRM. You just need to re-read the entire thread of conversation each time a response is written, then write a custom letter and then grammar-check, take one last look and send. Linker basically does most of that for you so you can engage 10x the number of contacts you would otherwise be able to. </p>

<p>What would it cost you to boost your team size by 10x? </p>
